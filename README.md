# Security-Native Interference Sandbox (QVM–QFM)

This repository is part of the Quansistor Field Computing (QFC) corpus.

## Overview

This document defines a **security-native sandboxing framework** in which security
is enforced as a **semantic property of execution**, not as an external runtime control.

The core attack surface is **interference**, not access.

---

## Core Contributions

- Sandbox zones defined by interference permissions.
- Explicit blast-radius containment.
- Semantic detection of security violations.
- Cryptographic sealing of security-relevant state evolution.
- Intrusion-tolerant collapse and deterministic recovery.

---

## Key Insight

> Security is about controlling influence,  
> not just blocking access.

Violations are detectable, bounded, and reconstructible.

---

## Security Guarantees

- Deterministic detection of violations.
- Replayable forensic reconstruction.
- Legal and regulatory admissibility of evidence.
- No reliance on trusted hardware or runtime trust.

---

## Status

Mature, claim-ready architectural framework.

---

## Relation to QFC

Defines the **security foundation** of QVM–QFM: accountable, semantic, and intrusion-tolerant.
